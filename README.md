## Running Solutions

First copy the repository to your local system, then navigate to the specific folder you would like to test, if you use VScode then once you have a terminal open in the intended directory you can use the command:
```
  code .
```
which will open a workspace in the directory, you can then view, edit and test the solutions.

To test open a command line in the VScode workspace using the short cut: `CTRL` + `` ` `` from there you can use the command:

```
  node <file.js> //you might have to install node
```
and the results of the solutions will print to the console, feel free to play around with the input values to see how robust the solutions are.

## [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) 

CodeWars was the first coding challenge site that I found and it is, in my opinion, the best available. This opinion is due to two factors:

1. I found their editor and test suit the most intuitive and user-friendly, that goes a really long way.
2. Their solutions rating system - only once you have solved a kata do you get access to the other user solutions but what is so great is is that you can vote for which solution you think is best based on a) 'Best Practice', and b) 'Cleverness'. The highest rating solutions are pushed to the top allowing coders to study the best possible solution and ultimately improve their future solutions. Each top solution also has a discussion which can make for some interesting reading for new coders.

As you might notice, these solutions were done early on in my coding journey so excuse my inconsistency with using `let` and `var` as I was still coming to terms with ES2015. All in all this website has been vital in developing my understanding of JavaScript and problem solving in general.

## [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

HackerRank is also a great site for coding challenges, I found the challenges in their 'Interview Preparation Kit' particularly good. My favorite thing about hackerrank is how they break challenges down into categories allowing coders to practice specific coding skills.

## [MasterClass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)

This course is said to bridge the gap between self-taught programmers and CS graduates teaching things such as big O notation, time and space complexities, recursion and many advanced algorithms. So far I'm finding the class very beneficial as its making me think of solutions that not only work but have the best possible time and space complexity.

## [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)

Project Euler is a great website for problem-solving as the challenges are mathematical by nature but work with large values that can only be solved efficiently with code. I really enjoy project eurler and want to do a whole lot more of their challenges.

## Other

These are simply algorithms that I can't put under a specific category, not much else can be said.

## Currently

I am doing the small bits of the masterclass each day alongside all the other things I'm frantically trying to do and understand. I am also busy taking place in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) competition but will only make my solutions available on Github once the competition has ended.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read me, I hope you have a great day further.
